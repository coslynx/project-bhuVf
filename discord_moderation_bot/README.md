# discord_moderation_bot/README.md

This project aims to develop a Discord moderation bot using Python and the Discord API. The bot will have various features to assist server administrators and moderators in maintaining order within the server.

The bot will include automated message filtering, customizable moderation commands, role management tools, automatic welcome messages, scheduled message posting, activity tracking, customizable logging, integration with external moderation tools, a user-friendly dashboard, and regular updates and maintenance.

To enhance the functionality of the bot, machine learning algorithms will be implemented for content filtering, a reporting system will be added for rule violations, integration with third-party moderation services will be included, a user reputation system will be implemented, the dashboard will be enhanced with data visualization tools, comprehensive documentation and support will be offered, and regular security audits will be conducted.

The project structure includes the following files and directories:

- `src/main.py`: Entry point for the bot application.
- `src/bot.py`: Implementation of the Discord bot class.
- `src/moderation_commands.py`: Customizable moderation commands for muting, kicking, and banning users.
- `src/role_management.py`: Tools for assigning and removing roles based on user behavior.
- `src/message_handling.py`: Functions for handling messages and filtering inappropriate content.
- `src/activity_tracking.py`: Logic for monitoring user engagement and behavior.
- `src/logging.py`: Implementation of logging moderation actions for record-keeping.
- `src/external_tools_integration.py`: Integration with external moderation tools for enhanced functionality.
